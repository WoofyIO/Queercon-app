# Queercon ionic app
The NG app, linked to appcenter.ms


Now using native ionic + cordova.

Please look at the issues for things to work on if your looking for something to keep you busy ;)

All source code for editing is in: Queercon/src  
The cert is there in build for android.. its not actuly tied to the deployment.. nice try ;)
