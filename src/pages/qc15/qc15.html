			The main event is back for our fifteenth year! Everything you need to know will be here as the information comes avalible. In the mean time we have made an important anouncement as to how we will be running events this year. Check out the full anouncement bellow, but here is the TL;DR:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Queercon will have two different types of Badges this year: Our usual (and fantastic) Electronic Badge, as well as a Non-Electronic Badge.
				</li>
				<li>
					A Queercon Badge (Electronic or Non) will be required for attendance to many of our evening events. 
				</li>
				<li>
					In continuing tradition, a portion of the limited-edition Queercon Electronic Badges will be available for reservation by a one-time donation in the upcoming weeks. 
				</li>
				<li>
					We are also making Non-Electronic Badges available by donation this year. 
				</li>
				<li>
						There will NOT be any method to reserve, or donate for, Electronic Badges onsite in Las Vegas. However, Non-Electronic Badges will be available for donation onsite. 
				</li>

			Queercon Badge
		</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			Every year, we create our own custom electronic Queercon badge (electronic badge is not required to attend events). Some badges are sold in advance to help pay for the event, but every year many of them are given away for free to attendees so everyone gets a chance to join the fun. This year's badge will be particularly awesome!
